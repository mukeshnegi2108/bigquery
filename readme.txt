Our challenge is to establish a user-managed Vertex AI workbench that seamlessly integrates with Jupyter notebooks and automates the provisioning process for new users. The primary goal is to create a flexible environment that caters to the diverse needs of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and data analysts.

The complexity arises from the varied requirements of these user groups. Data scientists often rely on specialized libraries, machine learning engineers have preferences for specific frameworks, and data analysts depend on their unique tools and data sources. Our workbench must harmonize these demands while ensuring ease of use and maintaining security.

To address this, we aim to implement a curation module. This module plays a crucial role by automating the provisioning process, configuring the workbench based on each user's role, requirements, and preferences.

The curation module will be responsible for creating user-specific environments, implementing access controls, allocating computing resources, and configuring software tools. This approach enhances user satisfaction, productivity, and user-friendly experiences, all while reducing the manual workload on support and IT teams.

In summary, our core problem revolves around providing a versatile and efficient Vertex AI workbench. Adaptability to diverse user needs and a streamlined onboarding process through the curation module are central to our solution, aligning with our commitment to creating an effective and user-centric AI workbench.
