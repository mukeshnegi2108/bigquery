Our challenge is to establish a user-managed Vertex AI workbench that seamlessly integrates with Jupyter notebooks and automates the provisioning process for new users. The primary goal is to create a flexible environment that caters to the diverse needs of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and data analysts.

The complexity arises from the varied requirements of these user groups. Data scientists often rely on specialized libraries, machine learning engineers have preferences for specific frameworks, and data analysts depend on their unique tools and data sources. Our workbench must harmonize these demands while ensuring ease of use and maintaining security.

To address this, we aim to implement a curation module. This module plays a crucial role by automating the provisioning process, configuring the workbench based on each user's role, requirements, and preferences.

The curation module will be responsible for creating user-specific environments, implementing access controls, allocating computing resources, and configuring software tools. This approach enhances user satisfaction, productivity, and user-friendly experiences, all while reducing the manual workload on support and IT teams.

In summary, our core problem revolves around providing a versatile and efficient Vertex AI workbench. Adaptability to diverse user needs and a streamlined onboarding process through the curation module are central to our solution, aligning with our commitment to creating an effective and user-centric AI workbench.

We anticipate the implementation of a one-time bootstrapping process, which will facilitate the provisioning of the service project and the necessary networking infrastructure. This critical initial step will lay the foundation for our data products ecosystem.

Once the one-time bootstrapping is successfully completed, the service project will be pre-configured with all the essential components required for our data products. This includes the necessary network architecture, access controls, and environment setup.

The significance of this assumption is that after the bootstrapping phase, we will be able to efficiently launch and manage various data products within the same service project. These data products will seamlessly integrate with the pre-established infrastructure, resulting in reduced setup time and enhanced productivity. This streamlined approach aligns with our goal of providing a robust and agile environment for data product development and deployment.

This assumption underscores the importance of a well-executed, one-time bootstrapping process, as it will significantly contribute to the overall success and efficiency of our data product initiatives within the service project.
